#Linear Regression_Co2 Emissions 

ANALYZING CO2 EMISSIONS AND THEIR ENVIRONENTAL IMPACT


Objective & Research Questions:

Our objective was to comprehensively analyze CO2 emissions data to understand their 
environmental impacts and explore strategies for emission reduction.

The research questions are:

1. What factors contribute to CO2 emissions and how can they be mitigated?

2. What are the current trends in CO2 emissions and their associated environmental 
impacts?

Motivation:

The project aimed to address concerns about climate change, global warming, unusual 
weather patterns, and ecosystem disruptions by identifying emission patterns and mitigation 
strategies.

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between the predictor variables 
(such as engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, etc.) and CO2 emissions in the population.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between the predictor 
variables and CO2 emissions in the population.

Data Description

The dataset sourced from Kaggle includes variables such as vehicle characteristics, fuel 
consumption, and CO2 emissions. It comprises both quantitative (e.g., Engine Size, Fuel 
Consumption) and qualitative (e.g., Make, Model) variables. This is the preview of the data.

Potential Models:

Statistical techniques like Regression or Time Series Analysis using R Studio were considered 
for the analysis.
